# Interface Segregation Principle 

This principle states that an object dont should be forced to implement certain 
features if it is available to others, and that classes should be able to 
override those features if necessary. It prohibits the implementation of a 
feature by a class if one of its ancestors is eligible. It helps organize data 
and code by improving the usability of a program.
